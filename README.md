# Washington Post Corpus Indexer
This repository contains code for indexing the Washington Post (WaPo) corpus with the [Python Whoosh](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) search engine.

It also downloads images and creates a directory of images for use with the indexed collection (including thumbnails).
